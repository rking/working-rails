# Working

Whoa!! â˜ˆking's opinionated rig for Rails dev.

- Guard for test running (`bundle exec guard`)
- 1:1 mapping between stuff in `lib/` or `app/` and the `test/` dirs.
- Plus the normally-odd ones (TODO: list these)
- Spork in effect for faster runs
- `charliesome/better_errors`, because they're better
- `pry-rails` for super-fast `show-routes`, etc.

## Example uses:

- https://github.com/rking/monkeynote

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'working'

And then execute:

    bundle
    working-init # this tinkers with several files (verbosely)
    # Note: the working-init-rails script is TODO

## TODO

Explain the parts.
